# NaiveDemoire
A fast demoire network that has comparable results with SOTA methods like ESDNet on FHDMi and UHDM datasets and gets SOTA somewhere.

I call it FDNet(fast demoire network), which has less than 1/3 params and 1/2 runtime of ESDNet.

However, I won't open the code until the paper is pubished, maybe never, because it's too simple to be judged useless.

I write this to record what I have done on AI, although it's a so small contribution.

Thanks for reading so boring words. Hope you have more significant contributions.
